## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a 
## matrix rather than computing it repeatedly. The following functions calculate and cache the inverse of a matrix.
## functions do		
		  
## Write a short comment describing this function		 
## makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to 
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, 
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the matrix created with the above function. If the inverse has 
## already been calculated it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates 
## the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
if(!is.null(m)) {
  message("getting cached data")
  return(m)
}
data <- x$get()
m <- solve(data, ...)
x$setinverse(m)
m
}
